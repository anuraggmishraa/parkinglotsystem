# PARKING-LOT SYSTEM
## PORTFOLIO

### Hello, I'm Anurag Mishraüëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ†Ô∏è PROJECTS
- **PROJECT 1**: The Parking Lot Management System: It is a comprehensive project designed to simplify and optimize parking facility operations. It allows users to register vehicles, store essential details, and efficiently manage parking spaces. The system dynamically allocates parking slots based on vehicle type, size, or availability, ensuring optimal space utilization. Real-time updates track slot occupancy, enabling quick identification of vacant spaces and improving customer convenience. A robust database securely stores vehicle and transaction data, facilitating audits and reports. Additional features include automated billing, license plate recognition, and integration with mobile or web applications for user accessibility. This project is ideal for modern urban settings, offering a seamless, technology-driven solution to reduce congestion, save time, and enhance parking management efficiency.

- **OVERVIEW:**
  
1. Vehicle Inventory: Maintain a detailed record of all vehicles, including make, model, registration number, and purchase date.
2. Parking Slot Allocation: Manage the availability and assignment of parking spaces for vehicles. payment options and cancellation features.
3. Reservation System: Allow users to pre-book slots based on time or availability..
4. Access Control: Restrict or allow access to specific slots for authorized vehicles.
5. Penalty Management: Automatically calculate and apply fines for overstay or violations.
6. Automated Billing: Generate invoices based on parking duration, usage, or subscription plans.


- **TECHNICAL STACK:**
  
1. Languages: C++
2. Algorithms: Linear search, qiuck sort, merge sort, Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
3. Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques


- **IMPACT:**
1. Optimized Resource Utilization: Better management of vehicles, slots, and payments ensures maximum efficiency.
2. Reduced Downtime: Proactive maintenance scheduling minimizes unexpected breakdowns and idle time.
3. Improved Asset Longevity: Timely maintenance extends the life of vehicles, saving on replacement costs.
4. Lower Emissions: Efficient vehicle usage and route planning reduce carbon footprints. resources. -Analytics for Growth: Data insights help optimize operations and make informed business decisions.
